<div>
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: larger; color: whitesmoke;">The
city of Agra is located on the Golden Triangle tourism route and is easily reached from
Delhi and Jaipur which are both around 200 kilometers away. If you want to visit all three
cities, the easiest method of travel is to go through a tour company that will arrange private
transfers between each destination for you.
To get to Agra from Delhi, travelers can use the high-speed railway,
which is a journey of 1 hour and 40 minutes. Another way to reach Agra is to take a private
car from Delhi, which can be more expensive but is often much more comfortable and convenient.
Traveling by car between Delhi and Agra typically takes around 3 hours.
